# Summary #

Using SearchMonkey, developers and site owners can use structured data to make Yahoo! Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites.

Share structured data with Yahoo! Search to display a standard enhanced result (available for certain content types) or use the SearchMonkey developer tool to extract data and build apps to display custom enhanced results.
